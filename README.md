Module 5 Assignment 

For this project I will be designing an electric motor. For this I will need emanulated copper wire of various size a metal shaft and some metal rods along with two powerful magnets and a power supply that has attached alligator clips.

For this repository and everything included inside, will fall under the MIT License so that anything can be used without any legalities attached.
